# Introduction #

If you came to here, maybe you know something about ISO8583.

If not, you can start learning about this ISO especification in [Wikipedia ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583).

This project want to develop a ISO8583 library to be used with Python.

And we have it!

And the best feature, it is 100% python!

So, download, install and use to develop your application.

But, remember that this library is released under [GPL V3](http://gplv3.fsf.org/)
